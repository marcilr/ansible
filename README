  Ansible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud
  provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service
  orchestration, and many other IT needs.

  Being designed for multi-tier deployments since day one, Ansible models your
  IT infrastructure by describing how all of your systems inter-relate, rather
  than just managing one system at a time.

  It uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure, so it's
  easy to deploy - and most importantly, it uses a very simple language.
  (YAML, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow you to describe your
  automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English.
