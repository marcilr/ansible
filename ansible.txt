Ansible


Ansible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud
provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service
orchestration, and many other IT needs.

Being designed for multi-tier deployments since day one, Ansible models your
IT infrastructure by describing how all of your systems inter-relate, rather
than just managing one system at a time.

It uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure, so it's
easy to deploy - and most importantly, it uses a very simple language.
(YAML, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow you to describe your
automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English.

On this page, we'll give you a really quick overview so you can see things in
context.  For more detail, hop over to docs.ansible.com.
