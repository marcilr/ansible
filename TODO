x Fri May 27 09:30:16 AKDT 2016 - Configured /etc/ansible/hosts with
custom ports prepeneded for non port-22 use:

/etc/ansible/hosts:
bornite:***
malachite:***
htpc:***

Fri May 27 08:23:51 AKDT 2016 - SSL key configuration for ansible?
Create /etc/ansible/hosts file:

/etc/ansible/hosts
malachite

Now ping all your nodes:
$ ansible all -m ping

malachite | FAILED => SSH encountered an unknown error during the connection.
We recommend you re-run the command using -vvvv, which will enable SSH
debugging output to help diagnose the issue
$

Suspect this failed since I don't think the firewall passes ping.

$ ansible all -a "/bin/echo hello"
malachite | FAILED => SSH encountered an unknown error during the connection.
We recommend you re-run the command using -vvvv, which will enable SSH
debugging output to help diagnose the issue
$


Added correct port to /etc/ansible/hosts did the trick:
  bornite:***
  malachite:***
  htpc:***


$ ansible all -a "/bin/echo hello"
malachite | success | rc=0 >>
hello

htpc | success | rc=0 >>
hello

bornite | success | rc=0 >>
hello
